# Bank_Account_Management

Every undergraduate coder undoubtedly has to go through one assignment on a bank account management system. I went through two :) This project includes two source files - 

The first:

- The main purpose of this project was to demonstrate the concept of Inheritance. Two classes Checking Account and Savings Account inherit from a class called Bank Account.

- The program allows the user to maintain any one of the two kinds of accounts (from the main function) incorporating functions of maintaining a minimum balance, interest rate, service charges, deposit, withdraw, print account information etc.

The second:

- The aim of this project was to demonstrate the concepts of Polymorphism, Operator overloading and Exception handling. 

- The Bank Account class is made abstract by having a pure virtual function. An object of either of the derived classes is created at run-time by initializing a pointer pointing to the parent class and then assigning an object of type derived class.

- Errors are thrown and caught in the program in three different places as well.
